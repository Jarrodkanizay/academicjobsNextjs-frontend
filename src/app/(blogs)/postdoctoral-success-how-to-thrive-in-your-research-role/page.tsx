              What is Postdoctoral Research?
            </h2>
            <p>
              A postdoctoral research, or postdoc, is a training-focused fellowship for someone who has completed their PhD. During a postdoc, individuals engage in further academic research to deepen their expertise and prepare them for high-level research roles in the future.
            </p>
            <p>
              For instance, a person who has completed a doctorate program in virology can choose to become a research fellow and research more on the effects and spread of viruses.
            </p>
            <p>
              While a majority of postdocs are in the STEM field, positions in social sciences and humanity are becoming more common.
