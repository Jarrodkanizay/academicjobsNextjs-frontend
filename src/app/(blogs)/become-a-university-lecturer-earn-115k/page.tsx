                    Publishing research articles in scholarly journals can
                    distinguish you as a leader and expert in your field.
                    Academic institutions often recognise such contributions and
                    may invite you to present your findings to colleagues.

                    Securing tenure can provide job security and the freedom to
                    pursue long-term research projects. As a tenured university
                    lecturer, you may also take on supervisory roles over
                    students and faculty.

                    Many university lecturers choose to share their extensive
                    knowledge by writing textbooks or nonfiction books.
                    Publishing your own books can further establish your
                    expertise and contribute significantly to your academic and
                    professional reputation.
