                      Example: "I completed my Ph.D. in Environmental Science at
                      Stanford University, where I focused on climate change
                      adaptation strategies. My research has led to several
                      publications in high-impact journals and presentations at
                      international conferences. I have taught undergraduate
                      courses in environmental policy and sustainability at
