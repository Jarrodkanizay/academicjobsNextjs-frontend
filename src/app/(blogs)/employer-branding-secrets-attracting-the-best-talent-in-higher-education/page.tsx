                Employer branding is the reputation you have as an employer and
                how it is marketed to job seekers and employees. It is critical
                for attracting and retaining top talent, reducing turnover
                rates, and cutting hiring costs, ultimately improving the
                business’s bottom line. A survey suggests that 69% of employees
                think it’s important for an employer to have a brand they are
                proud to support.

                Managing employer branding strategies to attract and retain the
                best talent is not easy. In recruitment branding, there are no
                instant wins. Instead, an organisation’s employer brand is a
                combination of small initiatives that collectively bring
                results. Let’s examine critical components of employer branding
                so you can create a plan that attracts and retains the best
                talent.
              </p>

              <h3>1. Develop Your Brand Identity</h3>
              <p>
                A great employer brand begins by focusing on a company's
                mission, statement, values, vision, and culture.
              </p>
              <p>
                These are the main building blocks of an employer brand.
                Consider the following ideas:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Determine how your business differs from the competition.
                </li>
                <li>Establish the company’s guiding principles and goals.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Example: The University of Canberra’s career page showcases the
                University’s commitment to diversity, embracing similarities,
                and valuing individual unique contributions, reflecting the
                institution's values.
              </p>

              <h3>2. Develop a Strong Employee Value Proposition (EVP)</h3>
              <p>
                An Employee Value Proposition (EVP) is what makes an
                organisation stand out from its competitors. It is the marketing
                message and promise that expresses the company’s deeper purpose
                and positive impact on the world. People want to feel that their
                work is meaningful, often even at the expense of a bigger
                paycheck.
              </p>
              <p>Tips to create a strong EVP:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Research what qualities your ideal employees are looking for
                  in a company.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Recognize the special perks and benefits your company provides
                  its workers.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Ensure that your EVP is genuine and consistent with your
                  brand.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                A strong EVP should outline both monetary and non-monetary
                rewards in exchange for an employee’s skills, experience, and
                efforts. For instance, consider including flexible work hours in
                your EVP if your target audience values work-life balance. You
                may also include support for employee career development if your
                target audience desires to grow within the company.
              </p>

              <h3>3. Conduct an Employer Brand Audit</h3>
              <p>
                You may not be aware of your company’s reputation among job
                seekers, so it is important to conduct a brand audit to enhance
                it further.
              </p>
              <p>Suggestions to get started:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Conduct internal surveys and get feedback from employees.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Examine reviews and feedback from career sites and online job
                  boards.
                </li>
                <li>Hire a firm that monitors reputation.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Glassdoor found that employers with leading employer branding
                devote time to monitoring employee engagement and taking action
                on feedback. For instance, if your employer brand suffers due to
                low ratings on job review sites, you may need to address
                specific concerns such as work culture and management style.
              </p>

              <h3>4. Create a Communication Plan</h3>
              <p>
                When executing a strategy to improve the market perception of
                your brand, use multiple channels to best reach your target
                audience.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Locate the platforms (such as social media, career fairs, and
                  job boards) where your ideal candidates actively seek
                  employment.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Write an ad copy that showcases the brand’s unique selling
                  points.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Maintain consistency in communication messages across
                  platforms.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Share videos, photos, blogs, and other forms of messaging to
                ensure you reach a large audience. If your audience is active on
                LinkedIn, share employee testimonials and content about your
                company’s culture and values. Using anecdotes about real people
                can increase the likelihood of attracting more qualified
                applicants.

              <h3>5. Create a Strong Diversity and Inclusion Initiative</h3>
              <p>
                The foundation of a strong employer brand is its commitment to
                building a diverse and inclusive team. This brings significant
                benefits, most notably that employees will feel like they belong
                and are safe at work. Employees who feel recognized among
                colleagues are more likely to perform at their best. In fact,{' '}

                higher education staff strongly agree that they have
                opportunities to learn and grow at work. This has been a major
                reason for employees seeking opportunities at other
                institutions.

              <p>
                By adopting these strategies, universities can build a strong
                employer brand. This will increase the ability to attract and
                retain the best talent in the competitive higher education
                landscape. Ultimately, this will reduce turnover rates and
                improve the business bottom line.
