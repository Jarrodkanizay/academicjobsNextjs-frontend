    bio: `Jarrod Kanizay is our trailblazing leader at AcedmicJobs.com and the higher education job market. In 2006, he founded UniJobs.com.au, which quickly became the leading Australian university job portal. It was renowned for its exceptional customer service, user-friendly interface, and affordable advertising rates. By 2015, UniJobs had expanded to 40 countries, becoming the largest university job network globally.
In 2013, Jarrod founded 'The Global Academic Executive,' a platform for addressing global academic issues, collaborating with prestigious universities like Harvard, Oxford, and Cambridge. In 2015, he sold The UniJobs Group to Times Higher Education (THE) and served as their APAC Managing Director until 2020.
Since leaving THE, Jarrod has remained deeply involved in higher education, focusing on issues such as internationalisation, politics, university rankings, and talent scarcity. Witnessing the decline of UniJobs and SEEK's rising costs and poor customer service, he is driven to create a new solution for universities. With AHEIA's support and a skilled team, Jarrod is committed to delivering agile, technically capable, and affordable services to meet the needs of the university sector once again.
Saddened by UniJobs' impending demise, Jarrod founded Academic Jobs with a dedicated team of nine full-time employees, including web developers, SEO specialists, marketing and communication managers, client relationship managers, a product development specialist, and an AHEIA manager.
The goal is to create a higher education job board to provide the services and results the once-successful UniJobs platform did. Academic Jobs empowers universities with better options, better service, and the power to fulfil recruitment and HR requirements.`,
